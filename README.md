# Mars Rescue

I am very pleased to announce that in just two days (relaxed, around 8 hours per day), I managed to make a complete game from scratch.

It‚Äôs super retro, and it was made for game jam 2022, with tech like it was 1989 :P

I hope you enjoy it a lot!

The source code is available, fully commented and easy to read, it can be used to learn, or study too!

It‚Äôs interesting that the whole game is a single code file, there are no external resources or bloated libraries or anything like that.

I generate everything procedurally in the same code.

There are also some old-school tricks to make the graphics work, like flipping pages, and using few colors, among other details.

Timing for modern CPUs with old QBasic was also a challenge.

All comments are welcome, I hope you have a great week!
